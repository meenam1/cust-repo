Bharath - Barghavi has sent some email for more changes on the portal. Work on that. I hope she would have discussed this with you yesterday. 
Ramesh - Regarding the enhancement which you were doing yesterday for upgrading the user to paid account, I believe you would have discussed this with Barghavi. Finish this task. 
Meenakshi - Did you test the installer with Ramesh's changes what he has done on the installer. 
Also can you test the portal on mobile mode.. Lot of UI changes have been done. Please validate those.
